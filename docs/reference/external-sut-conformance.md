# External SUT v1 conformance plan (proposed)

These are constructed design examples for the
[v1 wire contract](external-sut-v1.md), not captured output or passing tests.
Neither a Go external adapter nor a Java SDK exists in this change. The shared
[JSON vectors](testdata/external-sut-v1.json) are the common input for both future
implementation issues; do not fork language-specific copies of the protocol.
[ADR 0010](../adr/0010-external-sut-protocol.md) lists the engine decisions that
must precede end-to-end enablement.

## Vector format and consumption

`vector_format: 1` describes this test-data format; `wire_version: 1` describes
the transport. Every case has a stable `id`, a named `prefix`, ordered `steps`,
and descriptive `covers` tags. Expand `prefixes` recursively before the steps.
A prefix element containing `prefix` expands another named history; all other
elements are steps. Prefixes are finite histories, not arbitrary internal-state
snapshots. Every case starts with fresh peers and fake controllable clocks.

A step's `peer` is the receiver/observer (`go` or `java`). `action: receive`
injects the complete `frame` object. Serialize it as compact UTF-8 JSON and add
the four-byte byte-length header. Preserve the same serialization for an exact
duplicate. `action: local` injects a named lifecycle event with `args` through a
harness seam (runtime release, JDBC barrier, proxy exit, lease return, clock
advance, stderr, or child exit). These events and `expect` labels are test
vocabulary, never wire message types. Receipt can deliberately inject a faulty
peer message, so harnesses must not generate additional implicit receive steps
from a `send_*` expectation.

`expect` lists required observable effects in order; the assertions named
`no_*`, `ignore_*`, and `drop_*` forbid the corresponding side effect. For
example, `client_arrive_once` increments the Go runtime-call count once;
`wake_exact_gate` resumes only the identified Java gate; `no_worker_result`
forbids emitting any WorkerResult for the affected incomplete invocation.
`abort_run` requires a run error, not an ordinary worker failure or a verdict.
`invalidate_evaluation` rejects even a previously obtained passing evaluation.
`quarantine_fixture` requires `reset_rejected` until teardown/reprovisioning.
A `completion` event supplies independently observed proxy-exit, transaction,
and lease state; the harness must not treat it as a request to publish terminal.

`command_exception` injects the specified source exception into the named
invocation, at its `command_body`, `jdbc_operation`, or `after_commit_callback` barrier. Construct
the exception from `args.exception`, including the SQLException vendor code,
SQLSTATE and message; non-SQL exceptions use vendor code 0 and empty SQLSTATE.
The later completion event advances independently controlled proxy/lease
milestones. It must retain the observed exception, not synthesize one from a
terminal frame. The Java harness compares its emitted terminal to the explicit
Go receive frame's body as expected output only. In particular, an after-commit
exception remains an application error with a committed transaction.

Cancellation terminal messages follow the wire's canonical reason mapping,
including cancellation before a transaction starts. They are compared exactly;
no harness should invent a source application exception for a cancel frame.
A command exception such as the rollback case is independently injected through
`command_exception` and remains distinct from SDK-generated cancellation.

`stop_call` starts an asynchronous harness call; its `budget_ms` is the total
local cleanup budget, not the smaller graceful budget advertised on the wire.
An optional `call_id` names the particular caller. `call_pending` requires it
not to have returned yet. `check_stop_results` only observes the named calls;
it must not inject or fabricate their return values. It requires every listed
call to have returned the latched failure with `expected_error` as its cause,
never nil. With `expected_error: null`, every named call must instead have
completed successfully; a still-pending call cannot satisfy that check.
The failure comparison ignores incidental wrapper text. The repeated
Stop case checks both concurrent callers, then a third call after completion,
so cached success or an immediate nil from a repeated call cannot pass.

`stderr_bytes.args.segments` supplies exact bytes: decode each `hex`, repeat the
result `repeat` times, and concatenate in order. Assert the total is `byte_count`.
The retained tail must have length `retained_bytes` and SHA-256 `retained_sha256`.
The overflow input starts with one ASCII A followed by one MiB of ASCII B, so
keeping the oldest bytes produces a different digest from retaining the newest.

Go tests exercise Go steps against a scripted child and runtime double; Java
tests exercise Java steps against a scripted engine and controllable command/
DataSource. Each consumes the other peer's steps as the scripted conversation.
The combined integration runner exercises both roles. Preserve per-worker
causality; no total order between independent workers is inferred from pipe
traffic. Production IDs are random; the fixed hex IDs and credentials here are
synthetic test inputs only.

`framing` cases bypass object serialization: feed exactly `input_hex` bytes to
the decoder. `read_chunk_sizes` splits the leading reads; feed any remainder in
one final read. `eof: true` closes the stream afterward. Compare a valid decoded
object to `decoded` and require no dispatch before the entire payload arrives.
Also run valid frames coalesced and at every single byte boundary. Invalid cases
must fail before invoking application code. Where `control_hex` is present,
first require that fault-free frame to pass framing/schema validation in a
fresh decoder. Then run `input_hex` in another fresh decoder and require rejection
without dispatch. The malformed UTF-8 byte is inside a start parameter string;
top-level and nested duplicate keys otherwise preserve a valid start frame.
Thus neither a lossy UTF-8 decoder nor a last-key-wins JSON decoder can pass by
rejecting an unrelated schema or syntax defect. These cases exercise decoding;
no database startup is required for a control frame to be schema-valid.

A language implementation must report each case ID and its result. Unsupported
cases remain failing/incomplete acceptance work, not silently skipped coverage.
This PR validates the data's syntax and internal references only; executing
protocol semantics and publishing evidence markers belongs to the implementation
issues. When those tests add fixed-phrase markers, add their exact CI checks in
the same implementation PR.

## Sequence review

All sequences below are constructed. `E` is the Go adapter, `J` the JVM SDK,
`R` the Go runtime, and `DB` the fixture database. Successful startup is
`E start → J initialize/validate/probe/return probe lease → J ready → E Invoke`.

| Case | Causal sequence | Required observation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Success | Invoke → accepted → transaction begin → arrive → R.Arrive blocks → orchestrator releases → R.Arrive returns nil → targeted release → commit → proxy exit + lease return → terminal → oracle → stop/stopped/EOF/exit 0 | Exactly one result after cleanup; oracle alone judges database invariants. |
| Rollback | Invoke → accepted → arrive/release → command exception → proxy rolls back → lease return → terminal with error | Rolled-back outcome, error preserved, no early completion from a callback. |
| Database blocking | w1 holds row lock at an arrival; w2's SQL blocks before its arrival → Go WaitArrive timeout → release w1 → w1 commits → w2 reaches its point | Go infers blocking; pipe reader stays available and does not release w2 until its own runtime call returns nil. No Java `db_blocked` message. |
| Cancellation | Go context cancels bridge + sends cancel → Java gate throws → proxy rolls back → lease returns → terminal(cancelled) | No release from cancellation; context failure remains a failed operation. Already-committed work reports committed truthfully. |
| Process death | JVM disappears with a transaction/arrival outstanding → EOF/exit observed → session fault → bounded cleanup/quarantine | No invented WorkerResult; no oracle success, reset, or retry on the uncertain database. Death after terminal but before normal Stop also fails the run. |
| Stale arrival | Session A or invocation i1 retires; session B or invocation i2 uses w1 → delayed A/i1 arrive/release | Old identity cannot call B's runtime or resume i2. Session mismatch does not advance B's sequence; retired invocation messages consume current sequence without side effects. |

`stop_before_ready` exercises the alternate startup path: E sends start (1),
requests Stop and sends stop (2), then receives J's first frame stopped (1)
after cleanup. The local Stop budget is 5000 ms and the wire stop budget is its
2500 ms graceful portion, assuming no elapsed delivery time. EOF and exit 0 complete Stop without returning a Handle or running
a command. `unsolicited_startup_stopped` rejects the same first J frame when E
has not requested Stop.

`cancel_cleanup_deadline` explicitly cancels the Go invocation and unwinds its
bridge, delivers Java's cleanup fatal to Go, and invokes Go Stop with a 5000 ms
total budget before advancing its halfway/deadline events. E's best-effort stop
would advertise at most the 2500 ms graceful portion; the already-fatal Java
peer is not required to receive it or extend its expired watchdog. These are
distinct fake-clock events: Java's cancel
grace expiring does not establish Go's stop deadline, and a fatal-send
expectation cannot stand in for Go receiving that frame. The case intentionally
leaves child exit/reaping unproven to require a Stop error and reject Reset.

`cancel_before_accepted` requires a distinct `unstarted_outcome`, preserving
cancellation and proving no command/transaction/lease began. It forbids a
WorkerResult and runtime Finish. The Go harness for this case depends on ADR G5;
its future asynchronous outcome API must be decided before this case can run.
Do not satisfy it by closing the current result channel without a result or by
inventing a rollback.

`commit_wins_cancel` delivers cancel to Java after it has emitted and retired
the committed terminal but before Go receives that terminal. Java must consume
the retired invocation's cancel without changing its stored outcome, issuing
another terminal, rolling back, or raising fatal. Go still receives the original
committed result. The separate `check_operation_result` observer then requires
the enclosing Run's cancellation error under the pending G6 decision. It observes
the run-level result after completion, not another return from Handle or another
WorkerResult; it must not manufacture an error from the vector's expectation.

`stop_active_invocation` begins with a worker gated inside its transaction.
Go Stop cancels the bridge and explicitly sends cancel with reason stop, then
stop with the graceful budget. Java's canceled gate supplies the SDK cancellation
exception (`cancelled by stop`) under rollback rules. Controlled completion
milestones forbid terminal until proxy exit and lease return, and forbid stopped
until application/pool cleanup completes. `application_cleanup_complete` supplies
those independently controlled resource milestones; the harness must not invent
them from an expected stopped frame. Go checks the canceled worker result after
bridge unwinding, then requires stopped, EOF and exit 0 before the named Stop
call succeeds or Reset becomes allowed. `stop_still_pending` forbids early
success at intermediate receipt steps.

`cancel_at_arrival` checks retirement on both peers and then calls Invoke for a
new invocation using w1 and a fresh, uncanceled context. `invoke_call` invokes the
Go Handle (its invocation ID comes from the harness's deterministic ID source);
the explicit Java invoke receipt is the corresponding outbound frame. Completion
may name `invocation` when it differs from the first invocation in the history.
This adapter-only reuse path cancels only the first invocation's context; it
checks that supplied context directly, not a run-level error. It does not attempt
to reuse a terminal worker in the orchestrator's single-use runtime. The second
scripted command completes without arrivals and must not inherit the first
invocation's cancellation or consume a leaked capacity reservation.

`startup_submillisecond_budget` launches a child blocked on its first start
frame, then advances the fake clock so `startup_before_write.remaining_us` is
999. This value is remaining time to the previously established deadline, not
a replacement budget. The engine must neither round up nor emit a zero-budget
frame; detached cleanup closes pipes and reaps the child without first sending
stop. No application or database work can have started in this case.

`readiness_mismatch` now advances initialization/probe cleanup before injecting
the faulty ready response, explicitly delivers startup fatal to Java, and runs
Go's bounded Stop. With graceful cleanup unproven at the cutoff, it kills and
reaps the child and preserves the startup fault. Child reaping alone does not
certify application/DB cleanup, so Reset remains blocked by quarantine.

## Implementation checklist

The consumers are [Go adapter #108](https://github.com/weavegate/weavegate/issues/108)
and [Java/Spring SDK #109](https://github.com/weavegate/weavegate/issues/109).
Both implementation PRs must link this checklist and the same vector file at the
reviewed commit, copy the relevant acceptance items into their validation plan,
and record results against that revision.
[CLI integration #110](https://github.com/weavegate/weavegate/issues/110) owns
configuration enablement; [Spring evidence #111](https://github.com/weavegate/weavegate/issues/111)
owns the combined MySQL reproduction. Do not mark this design checklist complete
on the strength of prose or a mock-only test.

- [ ] Resolve ADR gaps G1–G6 in separately reviewable decisions before enabling external CLI execution: fixture descriptor, asynchronous fault propagation, reset quarantine, launch/config/budgets, asynchronous unstarted outcomes, and run-level cancellation precedence.
- [ ] Consume all shared vector IDs. Go owns runtime mapping, channel closure, process supervision, and error propagation; Java owns framing, dispatch, gates, proxy/lease tracking, and local cancellation. Both test malformed input and duplicate handling.
- [ ] Implement only child-JVM launch with framed stdin/stdout. Test fragmented/coalesced frames, invalid JSON/UTF-8/fields/version, unknown names/IDs, gaps, conflicting duplicates, sequence exhaustion, and capacity exhaustion without changing application state on rejection.
- [ ] Exercise concurrent arrivals and releases with barriers, including a blocked worker while another commits. The pipe reader/writer must remain live; no sleep-based coordination or polling for readiness.
- [ ] Prove fresh sessions for repeats/exploration, stale-session isolation, invocation identity on worker reuse, and no second command execution on duplicate input. Test immediate repeated point rejection remains consistent with the Go runtime.
- [ ] Against the pinned Spring proxy, transaction manager, Connector/J and pool, prove success, rollback, transaction-begin failure, rollback-only, after-commit exception, unknown commit/rollback, and suppressed connection-close failure. Record transaction and lease milestones separately; no terminal before proxy exit and successful lease return.
- [ ] Prove disabled Java instrumentation returns immediately from sync points without reading stdin, launching a protocol loop, or changing transaction behavior.
- [ ] Validate transaction registration and reject unsupported propagation, self-invocation bypass, extra DataSources, background DB writers, and async commands. Explicit test instrumentation must not alter the business transaction's intended invariant.
- [ ] Test cancel before accepted, at arrival, in blocked JDBC, during commit, and after terminal. Prove cancellation cannot be undone by release. Driver cancel requests alone cannot satisfy completion.
- [ ] Test startup failure/deadline, no ready, disconnect at each phase, silent child, blocked pipe writer, child death before and after terminal, nonzero exit, missing stopped, hung shutdown, idempotent Stop, and bounded forced termination/reaping. No elapsed phase can restart the deadline.
- [ ] Verify fatal faults interrupt execution and oracle evaluation, invalidate provisional success, and preserve nonzero run failure. Worker errors (including MySQL 1213/1205) remain terminal facts for existing oracles; no new verdict logic lives in the adapter.
- [ ] Prove Reset follows normal Stop and cannot run after uncertain cleanup until fixture teardown/reprovisioning. Verify no old connection, transaction, JVM thread, or queued bridge call survives into a later schedule.
- [ ] Verify readiness uses the fixture-provided endpoint and application account; probe lease returned, migration/reset owned only by Go, adequate worker/pool capacity, no credentials in argv/environment/artifacts/errors, bounded stderr, and stdout reserved before Boot startup.
- [ ] Add end-to-end vulnerable/fixed MySQL evidence with repeated runs (`-count=N` for Go) and record exact commands, counts, toolchain/dependency versions, and markers. Do not claim deterministic external replay from one pass or adjust waits to hide instability.
- [ ] Update public config/instrumentation docs only when implementation ships. If a new diagnostic is chosen, add its matching reference page and index entry in that implementation PR.
