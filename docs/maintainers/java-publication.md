# Publish the Java Spring integration

The `sdk/java` artifact is configured for Maven Central as
`io.github.weavegate:weavegate-spring:<version>`. The release workflow derives
`<version>` from the exact `v<version>` tag that also publishes the CLI. It
builds and verifies a signed Central bundle before uploading it; branches and
pull requests run only the non-publishing bundle check in the smoke workflow.
The ordinary development build and isolated Java acceptance job use no release
profile and retain their existing behavior. This describes the publication
path; no version is available until a tagged run successfully publishes it.

## One-time prerequisites

1. Verify ownership of the `io.github.weavegate` namespace in the
   [Central Publisher Portal](https://central.sonatype.org/register/central-portal/).
   Confirm the account can publish `weavegate-spring` under that namespace.
2. Create a dedicated GPG signing key, publish its public key as required by
   [Central's signing instructions](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/gpg/),
   and generate a Central Portal user token. Store these as GitHub Actions
   repository secrets: `MAVEN_CENTRAL_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` (base64-encoded
   private-key export), `MAVEN_CENTRAL_GPG_PASSPHRASE`,
   `MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME`, and `MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD` (the token pair).
   Never commit or upload the key, token, or generated Maven settings file.
3. Before the first tag, review the POM metadata, transitive dependencies,
   source and Javadoc JARs, and license attribution. Maven Central versions are
   immutable: a bad release needs a new version.

## Before each release tag

Run the repository [release checklist](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#releasing). Check
that the `java-central-bundle` smoke job passed for the tagged commit. It
uses an ephemeral signing key and no Central credentials. To reproduce the
bundle check locally without uploading, use an isolated GPG home containing a
throwaway key and a clean checkout:

```bash
export GNUPGHOME="$(mktemp -d)"
chmod 700 "$GNUPGHOME"
gpg --batch --pinentry-mode loopback --passphrase '' \
  --quick-generate-key 'weavegate local test <test@weavegate.invalid>' default default never
python3 scripts/java-central.py set-version 0.2.0-rc.1
(cd sdk/java && ./mvnw -B -Pcentral-release -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean verify)
python3 scripts/java-central.py build-bundle 0.2.0-rc.1
python3 scripts/java-central.py verify 0.2.0-rc.1
```

Replace the example version with the candidate tag's version. Run this in a
disposable checkout because `set-version` edits `sdk/java/pom.xml`. Remove the
temporary GPG home afterward. The verifier checks the four artifacts, signatures,
checksums, coordinates, metadata, and contents. The fixed
`JAVA_CENTRAL_BUNDLE_RESULT` marker is asserted with `grep -F` in CI. The
non-publishing build makes no portal request and needs no publishing secrets.

## After a prerelease tag

The release job first publishes the CLI assets. The dependent Java job imports
the signing key, creates a temporary Maven settings file from the token secrets,
builds the complete artifact set without uploading, verifies it, then publishes
with the same tag version. It waits for Maven Central to report the
version published. The signing key and credentials stay in workflow secrets and
temporary runner files; the bundle is not uploaded as a GitHub artifact.

From scratch projects outside this repository, use default Maven and Gradle
repositories to resolve the published coordinate and compile a class importing
`io.github.weavegate.sdk.Weavegate`. Use the dependency declarations in the
[Java peer reference](../reference/external-sut-java.md#supported-baseline).
Compare the resolved dependency version to the CLI release version from the same
tag. Save the two build commands and their output with the release evidence.
Do this after each prerelease candidate before treating the publication path as
accepted; the local bundle check alone cannot prove public resolution.
