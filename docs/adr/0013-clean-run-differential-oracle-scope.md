# ADR 0013: Scope a clean-run differential Oracle

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-09-12
- Issue: [#115](https://github.com/weavegate/weavegate/issues/115)
- Implementation: [#126](https://github.com/weavegate/weavegate/issues/126)

## Context

The v0.2.0 milestone promises richer Oracles, but the first Spring race needs
only the zero-row SQL assertions already implemented. Adding another Oracle
without a distinct invariant would widen configuration, execution, diagnostic,
and artifact contracts without adding a verdict that users cannot express
today.

The existing boundaries separate two questions:

- [`oracle.Set`](../../internal/oracle/oracle.go) composes any number of Oracle
  implementations and preserves every pass or violation in the evaluation.
  Adding more independent post-state predicates therefore needs assertion data,
  not another composition mechanism.
- [`sqlassert`](../../internal/oracle/sqlassert/sqlassert.go) executes one fixed
  read-only query after the scheduled workers finish. It deliberately ignores
  `oracle.RunContext`, including the reserved `Golden` projection. It can decide
  any invariant encoded entirely in the current database state, but it cannot
  compare that state with the result of another execution.

The second synthetic invariant is: **a scheduled execution must produce the
same configured account projection as a declared clean serial execution of the
same scenario from the same reset state**. Consider two histories whose
scheduled projection is the identical row `{account_id: 1, balance: 90}`. If
the clean projection is also `90`, the differential passes; if the clean
projection is `100`, it violates. Every query over the identical scheduled
state has the same result in both histories, so a fixed post-state assertion
cannot distinguish them without copying one clean result into its SQL and
changing that SQL whenever the clean result changes.

The executable counterexample passes different `Golden` projections to the
current SQL Oracle while presenting the same post-state query result:

```bash
go test ./internal/oracle/sqlassert \
  -run '^TestSQLAssertionCannotCompareGoldenProjection$' -v -count=1
```

It records `differential_verdicts=pass,violation` while the SQL Oracle returns
`sql_verdicts=pass,pass`. This is an input-data limitation, not a missing SQL
predicate or a reason to weaken the existing assertion.

## Decision

Implement one clean-run differential Oracle as the v0.2.0 richer-Oracle
deliverable. The implementation is required before v0.2.0 is complete, but it
is not a prerequisite for the first Spring/CI vertical slice: that slice keeps
using existing SQL assertions. A bounded follow-up issue owns implementation;
[issue #115](https://github.com/weavegate/weavegate/issues/115) closes only the
scope decision and executable limitation evidence.

### Execution and configuration boundary

The planned configuration adds a sibling collection rather than overloading
`oracle.assertions`:

```yaml
oracle:
  assertions:
    - id: active-assignment-is-unique
      sql: SELECT ...
      expect_rows: 0
  reference:
    mode: serial
  differentials:
    - id: account-outcome-matches-clean-run
      projection_sql: |
        SELECT account_id, balance FROM account ORDER BY account_id
      key_columns: [account_id]
```

`oracle.reference` is required exactly when `differentials` is nonempty. v0.2.0
accepts only `mode: serial`; the effective worker order is the selected
scenario's existing declaration order. Keeping scenario-specific worker IDs out
of the global Oracle configuration allows one differential declaration to apply
to every compatible scenario. One reference execution supplies every
configured differential projection; individual differentials cannot select
another reference or trigger another SUT execution.

The ordinary replay path cannot implement this reference mode. Its current
[`runCoordinator.execute`](../../internal/orchestrator/run.go) invokes and
bootstraps every worker before traversing the schedule, and a worker-grouped
schedule does not wait for one worker's terminal before releasing the next.
The implementation issue therefore owns an explicit reference-execution
extension point: reset the fixture, invoke only the next worker in
scenario declaration order, release that worker's declared sync-points in
order, collect its terminal after commit or rollback and connection return, and
only then invoke the next worker. This terminal barrier, rather than schedule
grouping, defines `serial`.

For each candidate or replay repeat, the reference executor uses the same
scenario, adapter, variant, parameters, and timeout policy and captures every
configured read-only projection. The engine then resets again, executes the
selected schedule, and gives the captured projections to the Oracles through
`RunContext.Golden`. The selected run remains the run reported to the user;
reference-run failure, timeout, or incomplete terminal state is a run error and
cannot become a candidate violation or PASS. A repeat performs exactly one
reference execution plus one selected execution regardless of the number of
differentials.

The projection query follows the existing SQL assertion restrictions: one
read-only transaction, no locking read, and the shared run deadline. IDs must
be unique across assertions and differentials. `key_columns` must be nonempty,
unique, present in every row, and contain deterministic non-null scalar values.
Duplicate keys or unsupported column values make evaluation fail because a
row-to-row comparison would be ambiguous. Declaration order remains the
user-facing Oracle order and `oracle.Set` remains the only composition layer.

### Deterministic evidence and diagnostics

The Oracle canonicalizes both projections by the encoded key tuple and compares
non-key columns by sorted column name. It emits three existing planned anomaly
classes:

| Difference | `oracle.Violation.Kind` | Diagnostic trigger | Planned code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| key exists only in the scheduled projection | `extra` | `oracle.extra` | `WG002` |
| key exists only in the clean projection | `missing` | `oracle.missing` | `WG003` |
| the same key has different non-key values | `stale` | `oracle.stale` | `WG004` |

Extra and missing evidence contain the complete normalized scheduled or clean
row respectively. Stale evidence contains each key plus paired
`expected_<column>` and `observed_<column>` values for changed columns. Column
names that would collide after prefixing are rejected during preflight. Rows
are ordered by canonical key, and changed fields by column name, before the
existing evaluation fingerprint is built. Repeating the same serial reference
execution and selected schedule must therefore produce the same verdict and
evidence or the existing flaky classification applies.

The implementation adds `oracle.extra` to the closed trigger vocabulary and
must ship `rules/WG002.json`, `rules/WG003.json`, and `rules/WG004.json`
together with one-to-one reference pages at
`docs/reference/diagnostics/WG002.md`, `WG003.md`, and `WG004.md`. The reserved
`oracle.duplicate` trigger remains unimplemented until an Oracle can identify
actual duplicate identities; this differential rejects duplicate projection
keys as ambiguous input and does not mislabel extra rows. Diagnostic derivation
continues to name an Oracle verdict; neither the orchestrator nor a fixture
classifies the difference.

### Artifact compatibility

The implementation records the resolved global reference mode and effective
scenario worker order, plus each differential's projection SQL and key columns,
as additive fields in `observation.json`. It records `extra_rows`,
`missing_rows`, and `stale_rows` as separate additive violation arrays; it does
not reinterpret `assertion_violations` or `oracles`. The ordinary artifact
version remains 2 under [ADR 0007](0007-artifact-version-policy.md): these are
additive fields and consumers already must tolerate their absence. Version 3
remains reserved for retained diagnostic-derivation failures.

The deterministic observation embeds the complete serial reference declaration
instead of adding an eighth file. A copied run directory therefore retains the
inputs needed to audit both executions without changing the public
six-or-seven-file artifact count.

## Consequences

- v0.2.0 has one concrete richer-Oracle outcome: detect extra, missing, and
  stale result rows relative to a declared clean serial execution.
- Fixtures with predicates that depend only on final state continue to compose
  zero-row assertions; they do not pay for a reference execution.
- Differential runs execute the SUT twice per candidate or repeat and reset
  between executions. This is a correctness cost, not hidden setup work, and
  the shared timeout/accounting contract must expose it.
- The selected scenario's declared worker order is reference evidence, not an
  automatically discovered proof of correctness. Its projection states the
  expected result for the selected invariant; reviewers must inspect it like
  any other Oracle input.
- Schema-constraint and fault-injection Oracles remain deferred. They answer
  different questions and are not implied by the v0.2.0 richer-Oracle promise.

## What didn't work

1. **Add another zero-row assertion.** Assertions already compose, and another
   post-state query sees identical input in the two-history counterexample.
2. **Place comparison logic in the orchestrator.** That would make execution
   decide a verdict and violate the Oracle boundary.
3. **Treat a fixed or Spring variant as the reference automatically.** Variant
   changes can alter domain behavior beyond concurrency control. The reference
   must be an explicit serial execution over the same resolved SUT inputs.
4. **Implement schema-constraint inspection first.** Constraints provide useful
   defense-in-depth evidence, but they do not compare application outcomes and
   are unnecessary for the first Spring race.
5. **Use a worker-grouped ordinary schedule as the serial reference.** The
   orchestrator starts every worker before schedule traversal and does not put a
   terminal barrier between worker groups. Reusing it would permit overlap in
   the supposedly clean execution.
