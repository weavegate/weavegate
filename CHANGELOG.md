# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

`YYYY-MM-DD` in a release heading marks a section that has not been tagged yet.
Replacing it with the tag date is part of the release process, and the release
workflow fails before publication if the placeholder remains.

[Unreleased]: https://github.com/weavegate/weavegate/compare/v0.1.0-alpha...HEAD
[0.1.0-alpha]: https://github.com/weavegate/weavegate/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Future CLI release tags also publish the matching Java Spring integration as
  `io.github.weavegate:weavegate-spring:<version>` to Maven Central, with source
  and Javadoc archives. `docs/reference/external-sut-java.md` shows Maven and
  Gradle declarations; publication begins only after a tagged release run.
- A composite GitHub Action at the repository root that gates a job with a
  published weavegate release. It verifies the release archive against that
  release's `checksums.txt`, runs the selected configuration and scenario,
  and uses the action's exact release tag as the CLI version when `version` is
  omitted. SHA, branch, and local action references require an explicit version.
  The action uploads the available evidence, and only then applies the CLI
  exit code. The step passes only for exit 0 with a complete version-2 PASS
  report and a successful evidence upload. The job summary includes the CLI
  version, verdict, and stored report when it can be shown in full.
  `docs/howto/ci-gate.md` has the workflow and the input and output contract.
- The composite GitHub Action posts the run's stored `report.md` as a new pull
  request comment, unchanged and as literal text, with the evidence artifact
  link and the steps to import and replay the saved schedule. The `comment`
  input disables it, and `comment-outcome` and `comment-url` report the
  result. A report too large for a comment is replaced by an artifact pointer
  instead of being truncated. A comment that cannot be posted, as on a fork
  pull request or a job without `pull-requests: write`, never changes the gate
  result. `docs/howto/ci-gate.md` describes the wrapper and the permission.

### Changed

- Go external SUT isolated acceptance now exercises every applicable shared
  lifecycle and wire vector, records observed evidence from repeated tests, and
  requires a complete manifest in smoke CI. The shared vector pin includes Go
  wire matrix cases and corrected startup cleanup observations.
- Configuration-only CLI selection of an owned external JVM adapter, with
  launch, registration, and start-frame-size preflight, bounded startup/stop
  composition, and external JAR provenance in the run manifest. Each JVM
  launches a verified, self-contained JAR snapshot, and repeated sessions share
  one wire run ID. Preflight validates and hashes one private JAR image, requires
  one manifest with unique launch attributes in its main section, and rejects a
  manifest `Class-Path` dependency; large named manifest sections remain valid.
  A stalled snapshot copy does not hold the run past its deadline.
- A completed run whose diagnostic derivation fails now retains its evidence as
  `artifact_version` 3 and exits 5. Ordinary runs remain version 2, preserving
  the released meaning that version 2 `diagnostics: []` means derivation
  completed and no diagnostic applied.
- `report.md` now renders every variable value through one Markdown safety
  boundary, which settles the rendering question the `0.1.0-alpha`
  compatibility notes left open. Non-printable runes and malformed UTF-8 bytes
  appear as escapes, and Markdown delimiters and dollar signs that would
  create markup, tables, references, or math are escaped, so a value can no
  longer split a field or introduce Markdown syntax. JSON artifacts retain
  valid UTF-8 values, but JSON encoding replaces malformed UTF-8 bytes with
  U+FFFD. A `replay:` line that needs no escape is still
  pasteable unchanged; one that contains an escape is a display form, and the
  command must be rebuilt from the original argument values.
  `docs/adr/0011-report-markdown-rendering-boundary.md` records the rule.

### Fixed

- A binary installed with
  `go install github.com/weavegate/weavegate/cmd/weavegate@<version>` now
  reports its module version in `weavegate --version` and in the run
  manifest's `weavegate_version` instead of `0.0.0-dev`. Release archives keep
  their linker-set version, and a source-checkout build still reports
  `0.0.0-dev`.

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- A deterministic sync-point runtime for coordinating worker execution.
- Exhaustive saved-schedule exploration and repeated replay.
- SQL assertion oracles that retain violating rows as evidence.
- `weavegate run` and `weavegate report` CLI commands.
- Six base run artifacts: manifest, scenario, observation, trace, JSON report,
  and Markdown report, plus a portable `schedule.json` when a run replays or
  discovers a schedule.
- Three-step replay lookup across saved run evidence, portable files under
  `<out>/schedules/`, and schedules built into the selected entrypoint, so an
  unchanged replay line can travel without its original run directory.
- `WG001` assertion-violation and `WG090` determinism diagnostics.

### Compatibility

This first tag fixes the following for `artifact_version` 2:

- The field names and meanings of `artifact_version` 2, as described in
  [`docs/adr/0007-artifact-version-policy.md`](https://github.com/weavegate/weavegate/blob/v0.1.0-alpha/docs/adr/0007-artifact-version-policy.md).
- The meaning of exit codes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 130, as described in
  [`docs/reference/exit-codes.md`](https://github.com/weavegate/weavegate/blob/v0.1.0-alpha/docs/reference/exit-codes.md).
- The `WG` diagnostic namespace and the `WG001` and `WG090` codes.
- The versioned top-level directory that a release archive extracts into.

It does not fix, and a later release may change without a compatibility note:

- How `report.md` renders a variable field that has to stay on one line (#43).
- Whether a completed run keeps its artifacts when diagnostic derivation
  fails (#44).
